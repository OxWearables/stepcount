## Data Dictionary

- **Filename**: The name of the data file.
- **Filesize(MB)**: The size of the file in megabytes.
- **Device**: The brand or model of the device that recorded the data, or the file extension.
- **DeviceID**: A unique identifier for the specific device used.
- **ReadErrors**: Number of errors encountered while reading data from the device.
- **SampleRate**: The frequency at which data points are sampled per second, measured in Hz.
- **ReadOK**: A binary indicator (1 for success, 0 for failure) showing whether the data was read successfully.
- **NumTicks**: Total number of data points recorded.
- **StartTime**: Timestamp marking the beginning of the data recording.
- **EndTime**: Timestamp marking the end of the data recording.
- **WearTime(days)**: Total time the device was worn, expressed in days.
- **NumInterrupts**: Number of interruptions in the data recording.
- **CalibErrorBefore(mg)**: Calibration error before any correction was applied, measured in milli-g.
- **CalibOK**: A binary indicator (1 for successful calibration, 0 for unsuccessful) showing the calibration status.
- **CalibErrorAfter(mg)**: Calibration error after attempting correction, measured in milli-g.
- **NonwearTime(days)**: Total time the device was not worn, expressed in days.
- **NumNonwearEpisodes**: Number of separate episodes when the device was not worn.
- **ResampleRate**: The new sampling rate after data has been resampled.
- **NumTicksAfterResample**: Number of data points after resampling.
- **Covers24hOK**: Indicates whether data is available for each hour bin of the 24h across any day. For example, if data is absent from 14:00-15:00 on Day 1 (and all other hours are covered), and then it is available during 14:00-15:00 on Day 2, then `Covers24hOK=1`.
- **ENMO(mg)**: Average energy expenditure metric, measured in milli-g.
- **TotalSteps**: Total number of steps recorded.
- **StepsDayAvg**: Average number of steps per day.
- **StepsDayMed**: Median number of steps per day.
- **StepsDayMin**: Minimum number of steps in any single day.
- **StepsDayMax**: Maximum number of steps in any single day.
- **TotalWalking(mins)**: Total minutes spent walking.
- **WalkingDayAvg(mins)**: Average walking duration per day in minutes.
- **WalkingDayMed(mins)**: Median walking duration per day in minutes.
- **WalkingDayMin(mins)**: Minimum walking duration in any single day in minutes.
- **WalkingDayMax(mins)**: Maximum walking duration in any single day in minutes.
- **CadencePeak1(steps/min)**: The highest cadence recorded in one minute of the day, averaged across all days.
- **CadencePeak30(steps/min)**: The mean of the 30 highest minutes of the day (not necessarily continuous), averaged across all days.
- **Cadence95th(steps/min)**: The 95th percentile of cadence of the day, averaged across all days.
- **Steps5thAt**: Average time of day when 5% of steps was accumulated.
